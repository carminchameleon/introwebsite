          <div class="aboutme_intro">When I just started to search for a job in Canada, I saw many job postings that wanted programmers. It was not easy to get a job with a language barrier. At that time I didn't have enough confidence in English. It was hard even made a resume and cover letter by myself. I realized it later, it was not easy even for native.

    I studied entertainment at university. I did so many teams and personal projects, but it was pretty hard to explain. It is better just show rather than explain in verbal. So I needed to show my assignments and projects through the website. My assignment type was variable from presentation to video.

    So I searched to make a web portfolio. And I saw so many attractive and dynamic websites. There are so many scenarios of pages to introduce my self in my mind. But when I visit Wix, it was pretty different from my expectations.
    Actually, at that time I didn't know that if I want to make that awsome website my self, I should be a skilled programmer.
    
    It was my first time to felt the necessity of learning to code

    In the past, I thought that way.  If I want to make something, I might work with a programmer. I've never thought that I will become a programmer.
    I worked in Starbucks as a barista in Toronto. My store located in distillery street. so I have so many regular customers who do programming. And when I saw my friend's major assignment, It was impressive to make some visible things immediately. I thought that /oh! Maybe I can do it too. / Now, I know it's not easy at all./
    Of course, now I know that it's really hard for me. Cause I'm a really basic level beginner.
Every single moment, we kept learning from history. I took a long time to think about my past and future. And now I have a simple plan. I just need to give it a shot.
